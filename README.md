WHAT IS THIS:
This is a JavaScript exercise to make a simple video game.

GOAL:
A top down view of your character as you move them across the floor similar to the game The Legend of Zelda.

HOW TO RUN:
Load index.html in the browser.

NOTE:
The only thing the player can do for now is move your avatar around. It will error when you hit the left or top browser walls. I'm still working on adding more things to do.
